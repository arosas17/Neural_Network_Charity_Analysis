# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The company, Alphabet Soup, has raised and donated money to organizations that help the environment and people; however, history has shown that some of the recipients of the donations would vanish as soon as the money is obtained without any impact. To counter this, a project has been initiated to create a deep neural learning network to determine which organizations are too risky to ensure that the money used is more impactful.
